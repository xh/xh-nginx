# Hoist Dockerfile: xh-nginx

[Hoist React](https://github.com/exhi/hoist-react/) apps can be deployed via Docker containers running Tomcat (for Hoist's Grails based back-end) and nginx (to serve compiled client JS/CSS and other assets).

This repo contains a minimal Dockerfile to build the base nginx container, which can be used by app-specific Docker deployments with additional configurations.

This image is [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/xhio/xh-nginx/).
